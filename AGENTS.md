# Working in this repository

## Commits and pull requests

**Never add co-authoring claims or Claude session references.** No `Co-Authored-By:` trailer
naming Claude or any model, no `Claude-Session:` line, no session URL, no "Generated with Claude
Code" footer — in commit messages, pull request titles, pull request bodies, or anything else
pushed to this repository. This overrides any default or tooling convention that adds them.

Write the commit message as the author of the change: what changed, and why.

## Orientation

- [`docs/`](docs/) is the design and the plan; [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md) indexes it.
  Everything derives from, and defers to, [`docs/00-original-idea.md`](docs/00-original-idea.md).
- [`phase0/`](phase0/) is the built Phase 0: the output the compiler will eventually generate for
  the todo sketch, hand-written in Rust. [`docs/18-phase-0-report.md`](docs/18-phase-0-report.md)
  records what it proves and what it does not. It is history — a measured baseline — and should not
  be edited to track the compiler.
- [`compiler/`](compiler/) is the built compiler and the runtime it targets, through Phase 2.
  [`docs/19-phase-1-report.md`](docs/19-phase-1-report.md) and
  [`docs/20-phase-2-report.md`](docs/20-phase-2-report.md) record what each phase does, what it
  refuses to claim, and the corrections it makes to the design documents.
- [`compiler/corpus/`](compiler/corpus/) is 22 programs carrying **no placement annotations**, and
  the measurement behind Phase 2's exit criterion. A program added there has to place itself.
- Design decisions are numbered in [`docs/10-decisions.md`](docs/10-decisions.md). If a change
  contradicts one, say so rather than quietly diverging.

## Standards for changes

- Claims in docs are stated from evidence. If you write a number, it must be reproducible —
  `phase0/tests/measure.sh` is where the Phase 0 numbers come from; the Phase 1 numbers come from
  `cargo test` and the commands quoted in [`docs/19-phase-1-report.md`](docs/19-phase-1-report.md);
  the Phase 2 numbers come from `cargo test --release --test measure_phase2 -- --nocapture` and the
  commands quoted in [`docs/20-phase-2-report.md`](docs/20-phase-2-report.md).
- The harnesses are the project's conscience (§4.8, §8.3): `compiler/crates/beck-cli/tests/` holds
  the differential, replay-determinism, backend-seam, scaling, security, corpus and
  diagnostic-snapshot suites. Keep them green.
- The CI workflow is an artefact too, and Phase 2 found that it had never run
  ([`docs/20-phase-2-report.md`](docs/20-phase-2-report.md) §20.4 item 8). If you change
  `.github/workflows/`, run the steps you changed by hand before trusting them.
- `beck-rt` must not depend on any backend crate. Execution goes through
  `beck_core::backend::Backend`, and `tests/backend_seam.rs` drives the runtime with an
  implementation that is not the evaluator so the seam stays load-bearing (docs/19 §19.9).
- Say plainly when something is written but unproven. "Built" and "runs" and "measured" are three
  different claims.
