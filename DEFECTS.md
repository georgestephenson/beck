# Defects

**What is wrong right now.** [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) is what has been fixed; this is what has
not. An entry is **deleted by the change that fixes it**, in the same commit, and the CHANGELOG
bullet for that change is where it goes on record. So this file is always the current list and never
a history — git holds the history, as it does for everything else in this repository
([`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md)).

**What belongs here: something that behaves wrongly.** Silent, misleading, or contrary to what a
document says. **What does not: something that is merely absent.** A feature nobody has built is a
line in [`docs/08`](docs/08-roadmap.md) §8.5, which is the only place that holds an order; putting
absences here would turn the register into a second roadmap that disagrees with the first.

**Every entry names the gate a fix owes.** This project has repeatedly shipped fixes behind gates
that could not have failed ([`docs/82`](docs/82-the-edge-report.md) §82.10), and the cure is to write
down *what would have to go red* while the defect is still in front of you. A fix that lands without
its gate has not been fixed; it has been made invisible.

**Ids are slugs, not numbers, and are never reused.** Entries are deleted, so a number would imply a
sequence that does not survive.

This register was opened alongside [`docs/104`](docs/104-styling-and-the-component-library.md) and is
**seeded rather than complete**: it holds what that audit found plus one older defect already
recorded in a report. Anything you find that meets the admission rule above belongs here, whether or
not you are the one to fix it.

## `non-durable-fold` — a decided construct is unbuilt, and the failure is silent

**What is wrong.** [`docs/10`](docs/10-decisions.md) D1 provides for non-durable folds — "high-churn
ephemera get non-durable folds — same semantics, no log persistence" — and
[`docs/15`](docs/15-scale-and-distribution.md) assigns hot ephemeral state to them. A `fold` that is
not wrapped in `durable` does not make a signal graph, does not get a page, and does not run. The
compiler does not say the construct is unimplemented; it reports the program as something else
entirely.

**Measured.** A program whose only state is `ui_state: Signal[State] = fold(apply_event, …, events)`
gives `ok: 4 definitions — a library: no durable state, so there is nothing to run`. The consequence
is that interface state — a modal's open flag, a date picker's visible month — has nowhere to live
but the durable log, so opening a dropdown is a permanent, replicated, replayed event.

**The gate a fix owes.** Two, and the second is the one that will be forgotten: a program with a
non-durable fold runs and its page reflects it, **and** the fold's state does not appear in the log
after a restart. A fix that only satisfies the first has built a durable fold with a different
spelling.

**Where it is argued.** [`docs/104`](docs/104-styling-and-the-component-library.md) §104.8, Wall 1.
The *language* question of where interface state should live is a decision rather than a defect and
is scheduled separately in [`docs/08`](docs/08-roadmap.md) §8.5.4; this entry is only that a decided
construct silently is not there.
